SAFE-LD Functions 

Explanation of the various functions:
1) create_phenotypes.R - this is where I extract the 20k phenotypes to be used to sample from 
2) create_phenotypes_with_block_corr_sample_effect.R - this is Claudia's version that creates blocks of correlated phenotypes, I have not used this yet 
3) internal_and_external_ld.R - this creates my external and internal LD and effect list for the models
4) prepare_null_LD.R - this creates all my R_simulated (for 5k, 3k, 1k, 50, 10 phenos for 30k individuals and 5k phenos for 5k individuals)
5) functions_for_susie.R - here are the definitions of all the functions that do Susie + compute the power and coverage
6) susie_fine_mapping.R - this is the script that actually runs susie in all the different scenarios
